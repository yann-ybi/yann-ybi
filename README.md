# ✨ Hi, I'm Yann! 👋  

As a **computer systems enthusiast**, I specialize in **scalable and robust systems**. My focus includes:  
- **High-performance & parallel computing** (e.g., CUDA, OpenMP)  
- **Distributed training** (e.g., EP, DP, PP, TP)  
- **Machine learning frameworks** (e.g., [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/))  
- **Systems optimization for AI workloads**  

Beyond ML systems, I have **extensive experience** in:  
- **Operating systems development**  
- **Cloud infrastructure** (Kubernetes, Docker, [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/))  
- **Database systems** (Cloud-native Streaming Databases)
